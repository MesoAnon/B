# Description

This is the repository for the paper "Benchmarking LLMs for Long and Multi-Document Legal Summarization". Included here are the scripts used to:
* preprocess (i.e., obtain extractive summaries) of the EURLEXSum and MultiLEXSum input documents (under `Preprocessing`);
* generate abstractive summaries using LLMs (under `SummaryGeneration`);
* visualise the ROUGE and BERT scores (under `ResultAnalysis`).

Each folder's files will be discussed in more detail below.
